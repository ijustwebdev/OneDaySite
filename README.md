# OneDaySite
Static site in one day challenge I made for myself.

I was pretty rusty so I decided to give myself a site to clone and do what I could in a single day. This is from Frontendmentor's website and it was a good page to try to replicate. I did the hero image in photoshop with a stock image I found on unsplash. 

I know this site is rickety and held together with toothpicks and gum. I don't expect to win any awards for code clarity or efficiency. Regardless, I learned some new things and refreshed my memory for previously learned things. The most difficult part was getting the images in the middle to play well with the accent square.
